# 🗺️ Roadmap

We have big plans for **Mongo ERD Generator**! Here is what we are working on next.

## 🔜 Upcoming Features

### 1. Enhanced Schema Explorer
We plan to add a rich tabbed interface to the visualization tool:

- **Collections Tab**: A detailed list of all collections with their fields, types, and indexes.
- **Objects Tab**: Deep dive into embedded documents and sub-schemas.
- **References Tab**: A dedicated view for all detected relationships, showing source, target, and cardinality.

### 2. Improved UI/UX
- **Search & Filter**: Quickly find tables and fields in large diagrams.
- **Dark Mode**: Native dark mode support for the viewer.
- **Export Options**: Export to PDF, SQL, or JSON schema.

### 3. Advanced Analysis
- **Custom Rules**: Allow users to define custom relationship rules.
- **Validation**: Compare schema against Mongoose models.
